\title{Fit measures for QML and LMS models}
\usage{
fit_modsem_da(model, chisq = TRUE, lav.fit = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{fitted model. Thereafter, you can use 'compare_fit()'
to assess the comparative fit of the models. If the interaction effect makes
the model better, and e.g., the RMSEA is good for the baseline model,
the interaction model likely has a good RMSEA as well.}

\item{chisq}{should Chi-Square based fit-measures be calculated?}

\item{lav.fit}{Should fit indices from the \code{lavaan} model used to optimize
the starting parameters be included (if available)? This is usually only approprioate
for linear models (i.e., no interaction effects), where the parameter estimates
for LMS and QML are equivalent to ML estimates from lavaan.}
}
\description{
Calculates chi-sq test and p-value, as well as RMSEA for
the LMS and QML models. Note that the Chi-Square based fit measures should be calculated
for the baseline model, i.e., the model without the interaction effect
}
