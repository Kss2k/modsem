plot_interaction(
  x,
  z,

  xz = NULL,
  vals_x = seq(-3, 3, 0.001),

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character string specifying the focal predictor (x-axis variable).}

\item{z}{A character string specifying the moderator variable.}

\item{y}{A character string specifying the outcome (dependent) variable.}

\item{xz}{A character string specifying the interaction term (\code{x:z}).
If \code{NULL}, the term is created automatically as \code{paste(x, z, sep = ":")}.
Some SEM backends may handle the interaction term differently (for instance, by
removing or modifying the colon), and this function attempts to reconcile that
internally.}

\item{vals_x}{A numeric vector of values at which to compute and plot the focal
predictor \code{x}. The default is \code{seq(-3, 3, .001)}, which provides a
relatively fine grid for smooth lines. If \code{rescale=TRUE}, these values
are in standardized (mean-centered and scaled) units, and will be converted back
to the original metric in the internal computation of predicted means.}

\item{vals_z}{A numeric vector of values of the moderator \code{z} at which to draw
separate regression lines. Each distinct value in \code{vals_z} defines a separate
group (plotted with a different color). If \code{rescale=TRUE}, these values
are also assumed to be in standardized units.}

\item{model}{An object of class \code{\link{modsem_pi}}, \code{\link{modsem_da}}, 
\code{\link{modsem_mplus}}, or possibly a \code{lavaan} object. Must be a fitted
SEM model containing paths for \code{y ~ x + z + x:z}.}

\item{alpha_se}{A numeric value in \([0, 1]\) specifying the transparency of
the confidence/prediction interval ribbon. Default is \code{0.15}.}

\item{digits}{An integer specifying the number of decimal places to which the
moderator values (\code{z}) are rounded for labeling/grouping in the plot.}

\item{ci_width}{A numeric value in \((0,1)\) indicating the coverage of the
confidence (or prediction) interval. The default is \code{0.95} for a 95\%
interval.}

\item{ci_type}{A character string specifying whether to compute
\code{"confidence"} intervals (for the mean of the predicted values, default)
or \code{"prediction"} intervals (which include residual variance).}

\item{rescale}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), \code{vals_x} and \code{vals_z}
are interpreted as standardized units, which are mapped back to the raw scale
before computing predictions. If \code{FALSE}, \code{vals_x} and \code{vals_z}
are taken as raw-scale values directly.}

\item{standardized}{Should coefficients be standardized beforehand?}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to \code{\link{simple_slopes}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object that can be further customized (e.g., with
  additional \code{+ theme(...)} layers). By default, it shows lines for each
  moderator value and a shaded region corresponding to the interval type
  (confidence or prediction).
}
\description{
This function creates an interaction plot of the outcome variable (\code{y}) as a function
of a focal predictor (\code{x}) at multiple values of a moderator (\code{z}). It is
designed for use with structural equation modeling (SEM) objects (e.g., those from
\code{\link{modsem}}). Predicted means (or predicted individual values) are calculated
via \code{\link{simple_slopes}}, and then plotted with \code{ggplot2} to display
multiple regression lines and confidence/prediction bands.
}
\details{
\strong{Computation Steps:}
\enumerate{
  \item Calls \code{\link{simple_slopes}} to compute the predicted values of \code{y}
        at the specified grid of \code{x} and \code{z} values.
  \item Groups the resulting predictions by unique \code{z}-values (rounded to
        \code{digits}) to create colored lines.
  \item Plots these lines using \code{ggplot2}, adding ribbons for confidence
        (or prediction) intervals, with transparency controlled by \code{alpha_se}.
}

\strong{Interpretation:}
Each line in the plot corresponds to the regression of \code{y} on \code{x} at
a given level of \code{z}. The shaded region around each line (ribbon) shows
either the confidence interval for the predicted mean (if \code{ci_type =
"confidence"}) or the prediction interval for individual observations (if
\code{ci_type = "prediction"}). Where the ribbons do not overlap, there is
evidence that the lines differ significantly over that range of \code{x}.
